# D-Rats-WebMap-server 


Idea of this application is to extend the D-Rats application with a webserver 
able to display GPS positions onto a map is run on 
    
to use this module:

- launch the listening server via the .bat file
    - the basic ports are 
        - 5010 for web output
        - 5011 for listening gps calls from d-rats
      (you can modify the ports directly from the batch file) 
- open a web page on http://localhost:5010 to see the map
- open d-rats starting from version 0.3.4alfa2 and configure
