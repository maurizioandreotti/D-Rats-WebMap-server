# D-Rats-WebMap-server 


Idea of this application is to extend the D-Rats application with a webserver 
able to display GPS positions onto a map is run on 
    
to use this module:

- launch the listening server via the .bat file
    - the basic ports are 
        - 5010 for web output
        - 5011 for listening gps calls from d-rats
      (you can modify the ports directly from the batch file) 
- open a web page on http://localhost:5010 to see the map
- open d-rats starting from version 0.3.4alfa2 and configure


REQUIREMENTS
WebMap extension it is an "alfa" software. almost no debughas been done and there is no assurance that it will work on your pc as it does on mine.


In order to work the WebMap requires:

- python 2.7 and some libraries

- to be launched from the source code via the ".bat" file.

If there is interest (and support) in this work, i can see to provide an installer or a precompiled version
