# D-Rats-WebMap-server 

Idea of this application is to extend the D-Rats application with a webserver 
able to display GPS positions onto a map is run on 
    
to use this module:

- launch the listening server via the .bat file
    - the basic ports are 
        - 8010 for web output
        - 8011 for listening gps calls from d-rats
      (you can modify the ports directly from the batch file) 
- open a web page on http://localhost:8010 to see the map
- open d-rats starting from version 0.3.4alfa2 and configure in GPS Settings to send positions to map server on port 8011


REQUIREMENTS
WebMap extension it is an "alfa" software. almost no debughas been done and there is no assurance that it will work on your pc as it does on mine.
